        <h4>"Rethinking Gradient Weight’s Influence over Saliency Map Estimation."</h4>

            <p>Class activation map (CAM) helps to formulate saliency maps that aid in interpreting the 
                deep neural network’s prediction. Gradient-based methods are generally faster than other 
                branches of vision interpretability and independent of human guidance. The performance of 
                CAM-like studies depends on the governing model’s layer response and the influences of the 
                gradients. Typical gradient-oriented CAM studies rely on weighted aggregation for saliency 
                map estimation by projecting the gradient maps into single-weight values, which may lead 
                to an over-generalized saliency map. To address this issue, we use a global guidance map 
                to rectify the weighted aggregation operation during saliency estimation, where resultant 
                interpretations are comparatively cleaner and instance-specific. We obtain the global guidance 
                map by performing elementwise multiplication between the feature maps and their corresponding 
                gradient maps. To validate our study, we compare the proposed study with nine different 
                saliency visualizers. In addition, we use seven commonly used evaluation metrics for 
                quantitative comparison. The proposed scheme achieves significant improvement over the test
                images from the ImageNet, MS-COCO 14, and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets.</p>

        <h4>"Denoising Single Images by Feature Ensemble Revisited."</h4>

                MDPI, Sensors, 22 (18), 7080, 2022.</i></p>
            <p>Image denoising is still a challenging issue in many computer vision subdomains. Recent 
                studies have shown that significant improvements are possible in a supervised setting. 
                However, a few challenges, such as spatial fidelity and cartoon-like smoothing, remain 
                unresolved or decisively overlooked. Our study proposes a simple yet efficient architecture 
                for the denoising problem that addresses the aforementioned issues. The proposed architecture 
                revisits the concept of modular concatenation instead of long and deeper cascaded connections, 
                to recover a cleaner approximation of the given image. We find that different modules can 
                capture versatile representations, and a concatenated representation creates a richer 
                subspace for low-level image restoration. The proposed architecture’s number of parameters 
                remains smaller than in most of the previous networks and still achieves significant 
                improvements over the current state-of-the-art networks.

        <h4>Image denoising:</h4>
        
        <p> This project focused on using self-supervised learning and ensemble methods 
            for image denoising. I developed an aggregated multiscale self-supervised denoising model, 
            which leverages multiple features from different scales to enhance the image quality. I have 
            done my Master’s thesis on this topic. The thesis can be download from <a href="/pdfs/thesis_Shafkat_masters.pdf">here</a>. 
            Also the code and main idea for my thesis in details provided <a href="https://github.com/khan022/aggregated-multiscale-self-supervised-denoising">here</a>.
            <br>
            I also co-authored a paper on this topic, where image denoising have been done with a supervised 
            training method. We have developed a custom network where shallow features are extracted and ensambled 
            to remove noise from images. The paper is titled “Denoising Single Images by Feature Ensemble
            Revisited.”</p>

        <h4>Explainable AI:</h4>
        
        <p> This project aimed to understand what a deep learning model sees when it classifies
            a specific class, an area of research known as explainable AI. I worked on developing a method to 
            estimate the gradient weights of the saliency maps, which are used to visualize the regions of 
            interest in an image. I also co-authored a paper on this topic, titled “Rethinking Gradient 
            Weight’s Influence over Saliency Map Estimation.” </p>
        
        <br>

        <h4>FRVT 1:1 face recognition:</h4>
        
        <p> This project involved developing advanced face recognition algorithms
            using deep learning and computer vision techniques. I was part of the team that implemented and 
            evaluated different models and achieved state-of-the-art results on the FRVT 1:1 benchmark.</p>
