    <h2>My Researchs</h2>
    <p>Some of my projects are:

        FRVT 1:1 face recognition: This project involved developing advanced face recognition algorithms
         using deep learning and computer vision techniques. I was part of the team that implemented and 
         evaluated different models and achieved state-of-the-art results on the FRVT 1:1 benchmark.

        Explainable AI: This project aimed to understand what a deep learning model sees when it classifies
         a specific class, an area of research known as explainable AI. I worked on developing a method to 
         estimate the gradient weights of the saliency maps, which are used to visualize the regions of 
         interest in an image. I also co-authored a paper on this topic, titled “Rethinking Gradient 
         Weight’s Influence over Saliency Map Estimation.”

        Image denoising: This project focused on using self-supervised learning and ensemble methods 
        for image denoising. I developed an aggregated multiscale self-supervised denoising model, 
        which leverages multiple features from different scales to enhance the image quality. 
        I also co-authored a paper on this topic, titled “Denoising Single Images by Feature Ensemble
         Revisited.” This project was also my Master’s thesis.</p>

         <h2>Research Activity</h2>

         <h4>"Rethinking Gradient Weight’s Influence over Saliency Map Estimation."</h4>
             <p><i>Masud An Nur Fahim, Nazmus Saqib, Shafkat Khan Siam, Ho Yub Jung. 
                Sensors 2020, 20, 5281.</i></p>
             <p>Class activation map (CAM) helps to formulate saliency maps that aid in interpreting the
                 deep neural network’s prediction. Gradient-based methods are generally faster than other
                  branches of vision interpretability and independent of human guidance. The performance of
                   CAM-like studies depends on the governing model’s layer response and the influences of the
                    gradients. Typical gradient-oriented CAM studies rely on weighted aggregation for saliency
                     map estimation by projecting the gradient maps into single-weight values, which may lead
                      to an over-generalized saliency map. To address this issue, we use a global guidance map
                       to rectify the weighted aggregation operation during saliency estimation, where 
                       resultant interpretations are comparatively cleaner and instance-specific. 
                       We obtain the global guidance map by performing elementwise multiplication between
                        the feature maps and their corresponding gradient maps. To validate our study,
                         we compare the proposed study with nine different saliency visualizers. 
                         In addition, we use seven commonly used evaluation metrics for quantitative 
                         comparison. The proposed scheme achieves significant improvement over the test
                          images from the ImageNet, MS-COCO 14, and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets.</p>

             <p>Distributed consensus mechanisms have been widely researched and made popular with a number of blockchain-based token applications, such as Bitcoin, and Ethereum. 
                 Although these general-purpose platforms have matured for scale and security, they are designed for human incentive and continue to require currency reward and contract functions that are not requisite in machine communications.

             <p><i>S Platt, M Oliver. IEEE 5th World Forum on Internet of Things (WF-IoT), 402-407, 2019.</i></p>
             <p>While direct allocation of spectrum and evolved medium access protocols provide a base for ubiquitous wireless connectivity, the existing TCP/IP and OSI models were designed for wired networks and do not address open interconnection of air interfaces. 
                 Without an interconnection model for the air interface, existing network designs continue to tie wireless medium access to that of the backhaul provider for ownership of access and identity trust, resulting in limitations on functionality and coverage. 
                 In this paper, we propose a novel solution to access ownership and identity trust by extending the TCP network standard, under a new model we propose, named TCP-Air which integrates distributed ledger technologies directly at the air interface. 
                 Further, we present two use cases of the TCP-Air model, demonstrating applications not feasible under existing permissioned-access network designs.</p>

             <p><i>S Platt. M.Sc. Thesis, Barcelona School of Telecommunications and Engineering, Polytechnic University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain, 2018.</i></p>
             <p>In recent years, network function virtualization and a software defined focus has allowed networks to become flexible and extensible in ways not possible previously. 
                 Although network modeling tools such as NS-2, NS-3, and OMNet++ have been extended with modules and code to support the absolute latest wireless protocols and medium access standards - there has been a growing gap in simulation of the layers above medium access which recent 5G use cases are designed to support. 
                 In this thesis, I measure the qualitative performance of application layer modeling in vehicle networks, taking the cooperative maneuver use case presented under "Project 5GCar" to design and simulate an autonomous merge algorithm using the VSimRTI network simulation stack.</p>

    <h4>"CoNTe: A Core Network Temporal Blockchain for 5G"</h4>
        <p><i>S Platt, L Sanabria-Russo, M Oliver. Sensors 2020, 20, 5281.</i></p>
        <p>Virtual Network Functions allow the effective separation between hardware and network functionality, a strong paradigm shift from previously tightly integrated monolithic, vendor, and technology dependent deployments. 
            In this virtualized paradigm, all aspects of network operations can be made to deploy on demand, dynamically scale, as well as be shared and interworked in ways that mirror behaviors of general cloud computing. 
            To date, although seeing rising demand, distributed ledger technology remains largely incompatible in such elastic deployments, by its nature as functioning as an immutable record store. 
            This work focuses on the structural incompatibility of current blockchain designs and proposes a novel, temporal blockchain design built atop federated byzantine agreement, which has the ability to dynamically scale and be packaged as a Virtual Network Function (VNF) for the 5G Core.</p>
